By subscribing to the Program, accessing its content, or otherwise participating in any Abacus-related activities, the undersigned individual or entity (“Participant” or “you”) irrevocably agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
1. Purpose and Scope of the Program
The Program is designed solely to provide educational access to lectures, live trading demonstrations, interactive workshops, and related instructional content concerning financial markets.
All materials and activities are strictly educational and informational in nature. Nothing presented shall be interpreted as:
investment advice;


financial, accounting, tax, or legal advice;


a solicitation or recommendation to buy, hold, or sell any financial instrument or any other asset, tangible or intangible, digital or physical, whether regulated or unregulated;


personalized or individualized advisory services.
2. Educational Nature, Disclaimers, and Acknowledgments
2.1 No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship
Participation in the Program does not create any fiduciary duty, advisory relationship, or professional-client relationship between Abacus (or its instructors, affiliates, or contractors) and the Participant. Abacus is not registered as an investment adviser or broker-dealer in Canada, the United States, or any other jurisdiction.
2.2 Market Risks
The Participant acknowledges that trading and investment in financial markets involve substantial risks, including, without limitation, market volatility, leverage risk, liquidity risk, and the possibility of the total loss of capital invested. Past demonstrations or strategies are not indicative of future results.
2.3 Live Demonstrations
Instructors may, at their discretion, execute real or simulated trades during live sessions. Such demonstrations are strictly for educational purposes.
Abacus does not recommend or encourage Participants to replicate such trades.


Any decision to do so is at the Participant’s sole risk and responsibility.


2.4 Scope and Limitation of Liability
All disclaimers, waivers, and limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement shall apply not only to Abacus Exchange Ltd. itself, but also to its directors, officers, employees, instructors, contractors, consultants, affiliates, agents, and representatives, whether past, present, or future.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Abacus and such associated persons shall not be liable for any losses, damages, liabilities, or claims of any kind (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to the Participant’s access to, reliance upon, or participation in the Program.
2.5 Margin and Leverage Disclaimer
The Participant acknowledges that the use of margin, credit facilities, or leveraged trading accounts carries a substantially increased risk of loss, including losses that may exceed the original capital invested. Abacus has no responsibility or involvement in any margin, loan, or financing arrangements the Participant may undertake with their broker, financial institution, or third-party platform. The Participant assumes full and exclusive responsibility for any obligations, debts, or liabilities arising from the use of margin, leverage, or borrowed funds of any nature.
2.6 No Guarantees of Results
Abacus makes no warranties or guarantees of any kind, express or implied, regarding any financial results, outcomes, or performance that may arise from participation in the Program.

All fees are non-refundable, except as required by applicable law.


Subscriptions may renew automatically unless cancelled by the Participant in accordance with Abacus’s cancellation procedures.
3.2 Chargebacks
By enrolling in the Program, the Participant waives any right to initiate or pursue chargebacks or payment disputes without first providing Abacus with written notice and a reasonable opportunity to resolve the matter.
3.3 Access Rights
Access credentials are strictly personal and non-transferable.


Unauthorized sharing, rebroadcasting, reproduction, or redistribution of Program content is strictly prohibited.


Abacus reserves the right to suspend or terminate access immediately, without refund, in the event of any violation.
3.4 Billing, Cancellations, and Automatic Charges
Billing Cycle: Subscription fees are billed on a recurring basis (monthly, annually, or as otherwise stated at the time of purchase) and will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless cancelled by the Participant.


Automatic Charges: By enrolling, the Participant authorizes Abacus Exchange to automatically charge the designated payment method on file for each renewal period.


Cancellation by Participant: The Participant may cancel their subscription at any time by following the cancellation process available through their account settings or by contacting Abacus support at soporte@abacusexchange.org. To avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, cancellations must be completed no later than five (5) business days before the renewal date.


Effect of Cancellation: Cancellation will stop future charges but does not entitle the Participant to refunds for any fees already paid, except as required by applicable law.


Suspension for Non-Payment: Abacus reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Program if payment cannot be processed or is otherwise overdue.
4. Recordings and Content Usage
