Create a React + Tailwind CSS component that renders a pill email capture bar centered on a dark page. The bar looks like a rounded dark capsule with a green gradient button on the right, identical to this description:

Layout

Outer container width: max-w-3xl (≈ 720–800px), full width on mobile.

Height: 72px on desktop, 60px on mobile.

Rounded corners: fully rounded (rounded-full).

Inside the pill, left side is a text input (transparent), right side is a fixed-width CTA button.

Use CSS grid or flex so the input fills all remaining space and the button keeps its size.

Colors & effects

Page background: #0b0c0d.

Pill background: very dark, slightly translucent: #111417 at ~96% (can be bg-[#111417]).

Pill border: 1px solid #2a2a2a with subtle outer drop shadow shadow-[0_0_0_1px_rgba(255,255,255,0.02)_inset].

Inner soft highlight across the top of the pill: use before: pseudo element (absolute, top-0, left-0, right-0, h-[55%], rounded-full, bg-white/5, blur-md, pointer-events-none).

Button gradient: left-to-right mint → green (from-[#98f7b0] via-[#79e39e] to-[#51b97f]) with a soft inner glow (use shadow-inner + outer shadow).

Button text: white, bold.

Typography & spacing

Input and button font size: text-lg on mobile, text-xl on desktop.

Pill padding: px-5 on mobile, px-6 on desktop.

Button padding: px-8 py-4 (desktop), px-6 py-3 (mobile).

Placeholder text color: text-zinc-400.

Input text color: text-zinc-100.

Accessibility & behavior

Form element with onSubmit (prevent default and console.log the email).

Input type email with aria-label="Email", required.

Focus styles:

Entire pill gets ring-2 ring-emerald-400/40 when any child is focused (focus-within).

Button gets ring-2 ring-emerald-300/60 on keyboard focus.

Hover: button opacity 95%.

Mobile: full width with mx-4; stack height stays pill-shaped.

Deliverables

A simple page (App.jsx) with a dark background that centers <EmailCta /> vertically for demonstration.

Tailwind already configured; no extra UI libraries.
